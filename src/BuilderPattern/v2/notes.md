Using a `HashMap<String, Object>` constructor like:

```
java
Product(HashMap<String, Object> mp) { ... }
```

may **look flexible**, but this approach is extremely **dangerous**, **fragile**, and **anti-pattern** in Java OOP design.

---

## ‚ùå Major Problems with This Key-Value Approach

---

### 1. **No Compile-Time Safety**

You lose all the type safety Java provides.

Example:

```
java
mp.put("price", "1000"); // string instead of int ‚Äî no compiler error!
```

* You only get an error **at runtime** ‚Äî a `ClassCastException` or silent corruption.

---

### 2. **No Field Guarantees**

No one enforces that the HashMap contains all required fields:

```
java
HashMap<String, Object> mp = new HashMap<>();
mp.put("name", "iPhone"); // forgot price, brand, etc.
```

Now your constructor will either:

* Throw `NullPointerException`
* Or silently assign defaults (like `null`, `0`), which causes **invalid objects**

---

### 3. **You Must Manually Cast Every Field**

Inside the constructor, you end up doing this:

```
java
this.name = (String) mp.get("name");
this.price = (int) mp.get("price");
this.images = (List<String>) mp.get("images");
```

Problems:

* If the type doesn‚Äôt match ‚Üí runtime crash (`ClassCastException`)
* Tedious to maintain
* Painful to debug when things break

---

### 4. **Spelling Errors Break It**

If a key is typed wrong:

```
mp.put("brnad", "Apple"); // typo!
```

‚Üí No compiler warning
‚Üí `mp.get("brand")` returns `null`
‚Üí Leads to `null` assignment or exception

---

### 5. **IDE Support and Readability Is Destroyed**

* No auto-complete
* No validation
* No refactor support
* Poor documentation of what fields exist or are required

---

### 6. **Very Hard to Maintain or Evolve**

If you later change a field from `String createdAt` to `LocalDateTime createdAt`, you now have to:

* Update every place this map is created
* Validate and parse manually (`String -> LocalDateTime`)
* Possibly break all old usages silently

---

## üß® Real-World Risk Simulation

```
HashMap<String, Object> map = new HashMap<>();
map.put("price", "1000");  // Should be int, but is String
map.put("images", List.of("img1", 123));  // Mixed-type list

Product p = new Product(map);
```

At runtime:

* `price = (int) "1000"` ‚Üí `ClassCastException`
* `images = (List<String>) List.of("img1", 123)` ‚Üí `ClassCastException` when accessed

And nothing prevents this until it's too late.

---

## ‚úÖ When Is This Ever Acceptable?

Using a key-value map like this **might** be okay in:

* Script-based rapid prototyping
* Generic JSON parsing where schema is dynamic
* Low-level frameworks or generic builders (e.g., ORMs internally)

But **never** for well-structured domain models like `Product`.

---

## üîö Conclusion: This Design Is an Anti-Pattern

| Problem              | Impact                           |
| -------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| No type safety       | High risk of runtime crash       |
| No field enforcement | Incomplete/broken objects        |
| Manual casting       | Tedious and error-prone          |
| Typos in keys        | Silent failures                  |
| Poor IDE support     | Reduces developer productivity   |
| Not scalable         | Adding/removing fields is a pain |

---

### ‚úÖ Recommended Alternative

If flexibility is your goal, **use a proper Builder pattern** or create **named factory methods** that accept only validated types.

If you're trying to parse dynamic JSON ‚Üí use a DTO with a JSON parsing library (`Jackson`, `Gson`) that maps keys automatically and safely.
