## 1. Introduction

The **Builder Pattern** is a creational design pattern used to construct complex objects step by step. It allows for
more control and flexibility when creating immutable or partially optional objects, especially when constructors have
too many parameters (known as **constructor telescoping** or **constructor explosion**).

---

## 2. Problem it Solves

When a class has:

- Many parameters (some optional)
- Multiple constructor overloads
- Confusion due to the order of parameters
- Need for immutability after construction

**Example of constructor explosion:**

```
java
public class User {
    private String firstName;
    private String lastName;
    private int age;
    private String email;

    public User(String firstName) { ... }
    public User(String firstName, String lastName) { ... }
    public User(String firstName, String lastName, int age) { ... }
    public User(String firstName, String lastName, int age, String email) { ... }
}
```

This leads to code duplication, hard-to-read API, and confusion.

---

## 3. Builder Pattern Structure

### a. Main Class (e.g., `User`)

- Has private final fields
- Private constructor that takes a builder object

### b. Static Nested `Builder` Class

- Has same fields as main class (but usually mutable)
- Has setter-like methods returning `Builder` (for chaining)
- Has a `build()` method that returns the main object

---

## 4. Java Code Example

```java
public class User {
    private final String firstName;
    private final String lastName;
    private final int age;
    private final String email;

    private User(Builder builder) {
        this.firstName = builder.firstName;
        this.lastName = builder.lastName;
        this.age = builder.age;
        this.email = builder.email;
    }

    public static class Builder {
        private String firstName;
        private String lastName;
        private int age;
        private String email;

        public Builder setFirstName(String firstName) {
            this.firstName = firstName;
            return this;
        }

        public Builder setLastName(String lastName) {
            this.lastName = lastName;
            return this;
        }

        public Builder setAge(int age) {
            this.age = age;
            return this;
        }

        public Builder setEmail(String email) {
            this.email = email;
            return this;
        }

        public User build() {
            return new User(this);
        }
    }
}
```

### Usage:

```
java
User user = new User.Builder()
    .setFirstName("John")
    .setLastName("Doe")
    .setAge(30)
    .setEmail("john@example.com")
    .build();
```

## 5. Advantages

- Avoids constructor overloading
- Easier to read and write
- Flexible and scalable
- Object becomes immutable if fields are `final`
- Good for complex object creation with optional parameters

---

## 6. Disadvantages

- More boilerplate code
- Slightly more memory usage due to additional class
- Slight learning curve

---

## 7. Best Practices

- Make the target class fields `final`
- Make constructor of target class `private`
- Provide validation logic inside `build()` if necessary

---

## 8. Real-World Use Cases

- Building configuration objects
- Creating DTOs (Data Transfer Objects)
- GUI frameworks where multiple properties must be set
- Frameworks like Lombok (@Builder), Jackson, and more
- 
---

## 9. Summary

The Builder Pattern is a powerful design pattern for clean, scalable, and flexible object creation, particularly when
handling many optional parameters.

Use it when:

- Constructor has too many parameters
- You want to ensure immutability
- You want code that's easier to read and maintain


Great question.

Let’s directly compare **your earlier approach** vs. the **refactored one** to highlight **why the new approach is better**.

```
Builder b = new Builder();
b.setName("iPhone");
b.setDesc("desc");
// ...
Product p = new Product(b);

### 🔴 Major Problems

| Problem                                              | Explanation                                                                                                         |
| ---------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ❌ **Builder is a separate class**                    | Breaks encapsulation: `Product` depends on an external `Builder`. Maintenance becomes harder.                       |
| ❌ **Mutable Product via setters**                    | If someone accesses builder again and changes fields, product can become inconsistent (since it shares references). |
| ❌ **No method chaining**                             | Code becomes repetitive and bloated.                                                                                |
| ❌ **No validation in build process**                 | You can create a `Product` with `null` name or `0` price—leads to runtime bugs.                                     |
| ❌ **Redundant assignments**                          | You assigned `this.price = b.getPrice()` *twice*. Copy-pasting introduces bugs.                                     |
| ❌ **No immutability guarantee**                      | All fields can be modified after construction if you add setters later—violates object integrity.                   |
| ❌ **No compile-time enforcement of required fields** | No way to enforce setting mandatory fields like `name`, `price`.                                                    |

## ✅ Refactored Approach — Why It's Better

```
Product p = new Product.Builder()
  .setName("iPhone")
  .setPrice(1399)
  .setDesc("Latest model")
  .build();
```

### ✅ Benefits (One by One)

| Benefit                                      | Explanation                                                                                                           |
| -------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ✅ **Encapsulation (Builder inside Product)** | Builder is part of the `Product` class. It tightly couples construction logic with the product's definition.          |
| ✅ **Immutability**                           | `Product` has no setters. All fields are `final`. Once built, object cannot be changed.                               |
| ✅ **Method Chaining**                        | Each setter returns `Builder`, so you can fluently chain calls. Cleaner and less error-prone.                         |
| ✅ **Validation at build time**               | You can ensure rules (e.g., `price > 0`, `name != null`) before creating the object. No partially constructed object. |
| ✅ **Single entry point: `build()`**          | Forces developers to finalize configuration before object is created. Improves control.                               |
| ✅ **Clear object lifecycle**                 | Builder is only used during construction, discarded afterward. Product lives independently.                           |
| ✅ **Less error-prone**                       | Compiler will catch missing `build()`, invalid method calls, or improper sequencing.                                  |
| ✅ **Avoids accidental reuse**                | Builder is disposable; the final object is not linked back to the builder.                                            |

---

## 🚫 What if you didn’t change?

You'd be stuck with:

* Code that’s harder to read.
* Product objects created in inconsistent/incomplete states.
* Future bugs where objects are unexpectedly mutated.
* No guarantee that required fields are ever set.

If you're building something serious (like e-commerce products, user objects, orders), the **new approach prevents future disasters** while keeping your code elegant and maintainable.
